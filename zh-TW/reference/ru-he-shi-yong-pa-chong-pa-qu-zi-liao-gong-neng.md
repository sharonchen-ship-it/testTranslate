# How to use the crawler (crawl data) feature

## Functional Uses and Value

As a business owner, you may often be instructed by your supervisor to refer to or compile regulatory information on certain public websites.

If you have a technical background or are assisted by an engineer, you may be able to automatically retrieve data by writing a reptile program, but for non-technical people, it is usually only possible to manually organize one page, which is not only time-consuming, but also easy to miss key information.

At this point, you can take advantage of MaiAgent's crawler function, through the No Code method, quickly retrieve website content, automatically create structured data, greatly improve the efficiency of information collation, and invest your time in higher-value core business.
