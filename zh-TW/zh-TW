# How to create a knowledge base

## Knowledge Base Usage

Once the AI assistant has been created, the next thing to set up is the \* \* Knowledge Base \* \*, the data source from which the AI assistant answers questions.

Think of the knowledge base as an Open Book exam, in which an AI assistant finds the most relevant content for a question to answer. Although a large amount of data can be placed in the knowledge base, it is still recommended to upload content that is highly relevant to the assistant task. If it is not relevant, according to current retrieval technology, it may still cause irrelevant information to be found as an answer context, so it is not possible to answer the situation.

## Application scenarios

You can upload any relevant information in the knowledge base based on the AI assistant's core tasks.

If you want to create a product support assistant, you can upload the company's product catalog, user manual, FAQ, and other related documents to the knowledge base, so that AI can accurately respond to customer queries and provide real-time and professional service content.

## How do I upload a KB?

Go to “AI<mark style="color:blue;"> Assistant</mark>” in the “<mark style="color:blue;">AI Functions</mark>” section on the left, select which AI Assistant you want to create a knowledge base for, and click on the “<mark style="color:blue;">Actions</mark>” icon on the right.

Go to<mark style="color:blue;"> AI Features &gt; AI Assistant &gt; Knowledge Base</mark> on the left-hand side and click on the blue “<mark style="color:blue;">Upload File</mark>” button in the upper right-hand corner to upload the data you want the AI Assistant to know (different sizes of KB capacity will be provided depending on the scenario).

If you have a large file and a large amount of data, it may take some time for the system to process it after uploading the file.

You can view the progress of the process in the<mark style="color:blue;"> Processing Status</mark> field.

Current KB Supported File Types:

- Documents: `.doc`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.md`, `.odt`
- Spreadsheet: `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.ods`
- Presentation: `.ppt`, `.pptx`, `.odp`
- Other: `.json`, `.jsonl`
  {% endhint %}

\
Parser enables the system to “understand” the contents of a PDF file so that it can be searched, edited, or converted to another format.

If the upload file format is PDF, word, the parser will provide the following three options:

- MaiAgent Parser (default)
- MaiAgent Parser (Online)
- MaiAgent Parser (OCR beta)

Currently, we use MaiAgent Parser by default, which is especially suitable for application scenarios where structured data needs to be extracted from complex professional documents for AI system analysis.

{% hint style = "info" %}
Differences between the three parsers can be found in the Technician's Manual - Parser
{% endhint %}

\
If there is a problem parsing the data, you can also click the\ [Re-parse] icon to have the parser refresh the data.
